# ChessIndicator

**ChessIndicator** is an automatic on-screen helper for chess.com. It captures the current board position, converts it into a FEN string, sends it to Stockfish for analysis, and then overlays the best move suggestion directly on your screen.

## üöÄ Features

- Automatically reads the current chessboard position from chess.com.
- Uses Stockfish to calculate the best move.

## üñ•Ô∏è User Interface

The main UI includes two groups of radio buttons:

- **Side Selection**:  
  - Choose whether you're playing as **White** or **Black**.

- **Calculation Speed**:  
  - Options: `100ms`, `500ms`, `1000ms`, `2000ms`  
  - Lower values yield quicker but less accurate results (~1500 ELO at 100ms depending on CPU).

- **Move Depth (Optional)**:  
  - Choose `3`, `4`, or `5` moves to analyze.  
  - Fewer moves = weaker but more stealthy.

## üì¶ Requirements

1. **Stockfish**:
   - Requires a local Stockfish binary.
   - Default path:
     ```
     C:\stockfish\stockfish-windows-x86-64-avx2.exe
     ```
   - You must change the `stockfishPath` in the code if your executable is located elsewhere.

2. **Display Setup**:
   - Works on **1920x1080 resolution**.
   - Requires **Google Chrome** in **fullscreen mode** on **chess.com**.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- **Do not hold or drag a chess piece during analysis.**  
  Mouse interaction can block the image recognition process.

- This tool relies on pixel-perfect board capture. Use it with the specified resolution/browser setup for best results.

- **Use responsibly.**  
  Tools like this may violate terms of service on chess platforms.

## üîß Customization

- The **default chessboard top-left position is hardcoded** at:
    public static int starting_position_x = 224;
    public static int starting_position_y = 152;
    public static int chess_board_height_w = 808;
